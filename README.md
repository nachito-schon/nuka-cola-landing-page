# Nuka-Cola Landing Page
Landing page for the ficticious cola drink brand from the Fallout video-game series built with [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/).

The main goal for this project is for me to learn **Bootstrap**.

I wanted to achieve a **modern landing page** design, with a nice hero section, a navigation bar with a menu that turns to drop-down in mobile screens, a couple "features" sections and a footer.

Of course, layout is fully responsive.
